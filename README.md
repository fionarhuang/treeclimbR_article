# treeclimbR

This repository provides toy examples to understand treeclimbR and codes to reproduce figures in treeclimbR article.

```

### Get started with a toy example

* We show how to run `treeclimbR` on toy datasets [here](https://fionarhuang.github.io/treeclimbR_toy_example/). Below are results of one toy dataset. 

* To capture signal patterns on the tree, `treeclimbR` firstly propose multiple candidates that are generated by tuning a parameter `t`:

</p>

Heatmap shows counts of entities (rows) in samples (columns) split by groups. Branches that include entities with signals are colored in orange.

* Nodes detected by from `treeclimbR` are compared to those detected by `BH` under FDR 0.05.
